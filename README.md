# React Employee Directory

## Description

In this project I used a random-user API (https://randomuser.me) to simulate a directory of employees.  This allows the user to search for a specific employee by either their first name, last name, email, city or state.  As the user inputs keystrokes, the table is filtered to narrow down the returned employees for quick and easy sorting.
